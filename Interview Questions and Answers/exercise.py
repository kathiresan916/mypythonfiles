#How would you remove all leading whitespaces in a strig:

a = input("Enter Value: ")
b = input("Enter Value: ")
result1 = a.lstrip()
result2 = b.strip()
print(result1)
print(result2)



#strip() -> Removes characters from the both the begining and end of the string. 
#lstrip() -> Removes characters only from the begining (left side) of the string.
